Design tokens are a set of individual values, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more, that encapsulate the visual and functional properties of a design system. They serve as a bridge between design and development, allowing consistent application of design decisions across various platforms and interfaces. Design tokens enable teams to maintain a unified design language, streamline collaboration, and ensure coherence in user experience.
