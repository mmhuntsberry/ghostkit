- **Generate the Token**: Click on the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.
- **Copy the Token**: After the token is generated, copy it immediately. You won't be able to see it again.

- **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt.
- **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the **`cd`** command to navigate to the root directory of your project.
- **Create or Edit .npmrc**: If you don't have an **`.npmrc`** file in your project directory, create a new file and name it **`.npmrc`**. If the file already exists, open it for editing.
- **Add Authentication Information**: In the **`.npmrc`** file, add the following line, replacing **`YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`** with the Personal Access Token you generated from GitHub:

```zsh
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

- **Configure Package Registry**: If the package is hosted on the GitHub package registry, add the following line to the .npmrc file:

```
@heast-design:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

- **Save and Close**: Save the changes and close the .npmrc file.

Now that you have set up the **`.npmrc`** file with the appropriate authentication, you can install and use the **`@heast-design/toolkit-foundations`** package in your project just like any other npm package:

- **Open Terminal**: Ensure you are in the root directory of your project in the terminal.
- **Install the Package**: Run the following command to install the package from the GitHub package registry:

```bash
npm install @heast-design/toolkit-foundations
```

- **Import and Use**: Import the package in your code using the appropriate import statement (ES6 or CommonJS), as mentioned in the previous example.

```js
import "@heast-design/toolkit-foundations";
```

```react
TBD...
```

That's it! You've successfully created a Personal Access Token on GitHub and configured your .npmrc file to use the `@heast-design/toolkit-foundations` package from the GitHub package registry. You can now integrate the package into your project and start using its features. Happy coding!
